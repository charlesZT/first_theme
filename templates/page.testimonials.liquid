		<p class="content">I engaged Zippertubing on a development project after careful review of their online products and capabilities. Matt and his team met with me and provided hands-on review and technical details of existing products and their impressive library of material samples. They offer robust protective coverings made from natural and synthetic fabrics, metal and polymer foils and films and a huge assortment of engineered structures developed for specific functions such as puncture and abrasion resistance, EMI shielding and more. We talked about our product performance demands and cost considerations. We also reviewed conceptual design details about our vision of the finished product. Just a week later Matt called me back for another meeting where I was shown actual proof of concept assemblies as well as functional prototypes. It took a few more iterations to iron out details, but the Zippertubing engineering and sales experts were able to develop timely and cost effective protective covering solutions to our demanding performance requirements. 10 out of 10.</p>
